- Heart Rate Counter: Toggles the display of the heart rate counter.
- HR Blink: Toggles whether the heart rate counter blinks.
- Heartbeat Sound: Enables or disables the heartbeat sound.
- Mute Heartbeat (Local): Mutes the heartbeat sound from your own perspective. Use this if you want to increase the range but avoid hearing it yourself.
- My Heartbeat (Local): Checks how the current heartbeat sound is heard.
- Sound Range Adjustment: Adjusts the audible range of the heartbeat sound. While adjusting, a **sphere visible only to you** will appear, so use that as a guide.
- Manual Heart Rate Adjustment: Manually changes the heart rate. You can set it within the range of 50 to 177.
- (OSC prefab only) OSC Automatic Control: Toggles automatic heart rate control. It will automatically turn on when an OSC signal is received (it can also be turned off while receiving).
